## My process

- first build mobile design
- then build desktop design
- then connect API, plug in data, and test

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow
- [AdviceSlip API](https://api.adviceslip.com/)

### What I learned

- I don't work with APIs often in my day job, so I re-learned how to do basic calls with them.

### Continued development

- I'd like to try building my own API and then building another version of this app using the new API

### Useful resources

- [AdviceSlip API docs](https://api.adviceslip.com/) - Referenced when making API calls
